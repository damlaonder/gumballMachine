# gumballMachine

This is a project I worked on when I first started to learn how to code. It helped me get better at understanding how to define my own functions in python. 

Using object oriented programming, I created a Gumball_Machine class and I use a random number generator that determines the color of gumballs in the machine. 

I implemented tester code to ensure the programs works.
